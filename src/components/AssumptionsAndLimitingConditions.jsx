  const defaultAssumptionsContent = `<p><strong>Legal Description and Title:</strong> The legal description furnished to us is assumed to be correct. We assume no responsibility for legal matters and render no opinion as to the title, which is assumed to be good and marketable. Any existing liens and encumbrances have been disregarded, and the property is appraised as though free and clear, under responsible ownership and competent management, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p><strong>Survey and Public Utilities:</strong> We have made no survey and assume no responsibility in connection with such matters. We believe the information in this report furnished by others, including but not limited to information regarding flood plains, geological fault lines, sufficiency of public utilities, wetlands, and land or surface subsidence, to be reliable.</p><p><strong>Floodplain, Fault Line, and Subsidence Studies:</strong> No fault line, floodplain, or subsidence study has been made by the appraiser, and these could only be undertaken by a qualified engineering firm. The presence of such issues could significantly affect property value.</p><p><strong>Environmental and Hazardous Materials:</strong> The existence of hazardous materials or toxic waste, which may or may not be present on the property, was not observed by the appraiser unless otherwise stated. The appraiser is not qualified to detect such substances. The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation, toxic waste, or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the property value. The value estimate is predicated on the assumption that there are no such materials on or in the property. No responsibility is assumed for such conditions, and the client is urged to retain an expert if desired.</p><p><strong>Construction and Condition:</strong> The construction and condition of the improvements (if applicable) mentioned in this report are based on observation. No engineering study was made, and no certification as to construction or any physical aspects is warranted. All work is assumed to have been done to applicable building standards, and we have assumed the improvements are free from any undisclosed or latent defects.</p><p><strong>Engineering and Structural Assumptions:</strong> This appraisal is not intended to serve as an engineering or structural report. No responsibility is assumed for the structural soundness, adequacy, or quality of the improvements, particularly the roof, foundations, and utility services. If structural issues are a concern, it is strongly recommended that a qualified engineering or environmental inspection be obtained.</p><p><strong>Zoning, Codes, and Licenses:</strong> It is assumed that the property complies with all applicable federal, state, local, and private codes, laws, consents, licenses, and regulations, and that all licenses, permits, certificates, and approvals have been secured and are freely transferable.</p><p><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):</strong> The appraiser has made no specific compliance survey or analysis to determine whether the property conforms with the ADA requirements. This appraisal assumes the property complies with ADA standards unless otherwise noted, and non-compliance could affect the value.</p><p><strong>Illustrative Materials:</strong> Drawings, sketches, maps, building diagrams, site plans, floor plans, and photographs included in this report are for illustrative purposes only to assist the reader in visualizing the property. Dimensions and descriptions are based on public records or information furnished by others and are not intended for legal purposes.</p><p><strong>Data Sources and Reliability:</strong> The cost data, sale data, rental data, income data, and other market information presented in this report have been obtained from sources deemed reliable, including public records, broker reports, and third-party data providers. While every effort has been made to verify the accuracy of this information, the appraiser makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding its completeness or accuracy.</p><p><strong>Market Fluctuations and Future Performance Disclaimer:</strong> The conclusions in this report are based on market conditions as of the effective date of the appraisal. The appraiser assumes no responsibility for future market fluctuations, economic changes, or alterations in property conditions that may impact value over time.</p><p><strong>Reliability and Scope:</strong> The statements of fact contained in this appraisal report are true and correct to the best of our knowledge and belief. Information, estimates, and opinions furnished by others and contained in the report were obtained from reliable sources, but no responsibility is assumed for errors or omissions.</p><p><strong>Assumptions about Inaccessible Areas:</strong> Any areas or portions of the property not inspected are assumed to be similar to those inspected unless otherwise noted. If discrepancies exist, they could affect the value conclusion.</p><p><strong>Management and Operation:</strong> Property management is assumed to be competent, and ownership is assumed to be responsible. The financial analyses assume competent management unless noted otherwise.</p><p><strong>Maintenance and Reserves:</strong> Reserves for the replacement of short-lived items with economic lives shorter than the building structure have been considered in the value estimate. We assume that all improvements are structurally sound, free of defects, and meet applicable codes.</p><p><strong>Valuation and Use:</strong> The distribution of valuation between land and improvements (if applicable) in this report applies only under the existing program of utilization. The separate valuations must not be used in conjunction with any other appraisal and are invalid if so used. The valuation estimate applies only to the effective date of the report.</p><p><strong>Digital and Electronic Distribution:</strong> This report may be transmitted in digital form; however, any modifications, unauthorized edits, or changes to the original document render it invalid. The original version, as prepared by the appraiser, is the only legally binding document.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure:</strong> This report contains confidential and proprietary information intended solely for the client and designated intended users. It may not be disclosed to or relied upon by any other party without the appraiser’s written consent, except as required by law or regulatory agencies.</p><p><strong>Client and Intended Users:</strong> This report is prepared exclusively for the client and the intended users identified herein. No other party may rely on its contents without the appraiser’s explicit written consent. Additionally, no portion of this report may be used for advertising or public dissemination without prior written approval from the appraiser. Any unauthorized use or distribution is strictly prohibited.</p><p><strong>Possession of the Report:</strong> Possession of this report or a copy thereof does not convey the right of publication. It may not be used for any purpose by anyone other than the addressee without prior written consent from the appraiser.</p><p><strong>Appraisal Use and Syndication:</strong> This appraisal is not intended for use in any real estate syndication and is invalid if used for such purposes. A real estate syndication includes organizations formed for the sale, trade, or development of real property on behalf of others.</p><p><strong>Testimony and Court Appearance:</strong> We are not required to give testimony or attend court by reason of this appraisal unless prior arrangements are made. Additional compensation for such testimony will be required.</p><p><strong>Tax and Legal Considerations:</strong> This appraisal report is not intended for tax or legal purposes. The appraiser is not qualified to provide legal or tax advice, and any conclusions within this report should not be interpreted as such. Users are encouraged to consult legal and tax professionals for specific advice.</p><p><strong>Engagement Conditions:</strong> This assignment and the payment of fees are not dependent on any loan commitment, sale, trial outcome, or receipt of funds by the client.</p><p><strong>No Future Obligation:</strong> The appraiser assumes no responsibility for conditions affecting the property after the effective date of the appraisal or the date of inspection.</p><p><strong>Compliance with Appraisal Standards:</strong> This report has been prepared in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), the Appraisal Institute, and the American Society of Appraisers.</p>`;
