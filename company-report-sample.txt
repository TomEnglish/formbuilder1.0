Market Value, as defined in this report, is the most probable price a property should bring in a competitive and open market under fair sale conditions, with both buyer and seller acting prudently, knowledgeably, and free from undue stimulus.

The estimated marketing time for the property is within 12 months of the appraisal date. Available market data reflects current local conditions, and no further discounting was applied to the indicated value. The appraisers certify no present or proposed interest in the property, that the opinion of value was reached through investigation and analysis of relevant data, and that the fee is not contingent upon the value concluded. This appraisal is subject to the extraordinary assumptions and hypothetical conditions outlined in the Scope of Work and the contingent and limiting conditions in the addenda. No services have been provided regarding this property within the past three years.

The appraiser(s) is not qualified to detect hazardous substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde, or toxic waste, which may affect the property’s value. Clients are advised to seek professional environmental studies. No responsibility is assumed for such conditions or related expertise.

Appraisal Report

This is An Appraisal Report which is intended to comply with the reporting requirements set forth under Standards Rule 2-2 of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (January 1, 2024).  The appraisal is presented in a summary format that presents discussion of the data, reasoning, and analysis that were used in the appraisal process to develop the appraiser’s opinion of value.  All supporting documentation concerning the data, reasoning, and analysis is retained in the appraiser’s file.  The depth of discussion contained in this report is specific to the needs of the clients and to the intended use stated below.  The appraiser is not responsible for unauthorized use of this report.

Purpose of the Appraisal

The purpose of this appraisal is to develop an opinion of market value of the fee simple estate of the subject property.  Fee Simple interest is defined as: “The maximum possible estate one can possess in real property”.  It is the least limited interest and the most complete and absolute ownership in land; is of indefinite duration, freely transferable, and inheritable. No consideration is given to the subsurface mineral rights, if any. No existing leasing agreement was provided or discovered by the appraiser.

Intended Use and User of this Report

The intended user of the appraisal is our client ‘Generic Client LLC’. The intended use of this appraisal report is to provide an opinion of the market value of the subject commercial multifamily real estate property as of the effective date of the appraisal. This report is prepared for the exclusive use of the named intended user to assist with internal decision making. It is intended solely for use by the named client/user and is not intended for any other purpose or for use by any other party. Our fee for this assignment is $1,600

Exposure Time

Exposure time is defined by 2024 USPAP as: 

“An opinion, based on supporting market data, of the length of time that the property interest being appraised would have been offered on the market prior to the hypothetical consummation of a sale at market value on the effective date of the appraisal.”

Based on our analysis of the market and with consideration to the comparable sales, it is our opinion that if the subject were available for sale during the 12 months prior to the date of the appraisal at a reasonable price, a sale would have occurred.

Marketing Time

Marketing time is described by The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 7th Edition (Appraisal Institute), as:

“The estimated time period it would take to sell a property interest at the concluded market value during the period immediately after the effective date of the appraisal. Marketing time differs from exposure time, which always precedes the effective date of the appraisal.”

Based on our analysis of the market and with consideration to the comparable sales, it is our opinion that if the subject were made available for sale and adequately exposed to the market at a reasonable price, a sale would occur within 12 months..

The Appraisal Process – Scope of Work 

The appraisal process for this report follows a structured and systematic approach, designed to develop a credible opinion of market value. This process involves a sequence of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting relevant data. The appraiser initially conducted a preliminary analysis to define the scope of work and establish the framework for this assignment. Following this, pertinent data was collected, organized, and analyzed.

On February 06, 2025, an on-site inspection of the property was completed, during which photographs were taken to document its current condition. Additionally, public records were reviewed to confirm the latest available tax assessments, as detailed in a subsequent section of this report. Land size was cross-verified with public records, and recent sales activity within the subject property's vicinity was analyzed. The following information was provided to the appraiser by the client:
General Property Details
General Details Concerning the Ongoing Remodel

Definition of Market Value

The most probable price, as of a specified date, in cash, or in terms equivalent to cash, or in other precisely revealed terms, for which the specified property rights should sell after reasonable exposure in a competitive market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, with the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably, and for self-interest, and assuming that neither is under undue duress. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby:
	a.	Buyer and seller are typically motivated;
	b.	Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests;
	c.	A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market;
	d.	Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and 
	e.	The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.
(Source: The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, published by the Appraisal Institute; and Office of the Controller of the Currency under 12 CFR, Subpart C-Appraisals, 34.42 Definitions [f]; USPAP, January 1, 2024)
Compliance with the Competency Provision of USPAP

According to USPAP, the Competency Rule discusses the need for the appraiser to have the proper knowledge and experience to complete the assignment competently.   No steps were necessary or appropriate to comply with the Competency Rule as defined in USPAP (January 1, 2024) as the appraiser has experience both in the market area and in appraising similar type properties.

Date of the Appraisal

The following descriptions, analyses, and conclusions of this report are applicable to the date of our onsite visit of February 06, 2025. The date of the report, or transmittal date, is March 07, 2025.

Use of the Real Estate

The use of the real estate as of the effective date of value is as an improved commercial site serving as a multi residence property containing a total of 19 units. This use is reflected in the appraisal report due to the value being developed with the land and improvements “Subject To” the completion of the ongoing renovation. 

Problem To Be Solved

The problem to be solved in this appraisal assignment is to determine the market value of the subject property, a 19‐unit apartment complex that is currently vacant and undergoing a complete renovation. Specifically, this requires identifying the appropriate scope of work and analyzing relevant market conditions as they existed on the effective date of the report. Key considerations include establishing reliable market rents for the renovated units, projecting occupancy and vacancy rates, and estimating the absorption period for achieving stabilized occupancy. Additionally, local market dynamics, the property’s condition upon completion of renovations, and typical market participants’ expectations will be evaluated to develop credible, well‐supported conclusions. It has been determined that the Sales Comparison Approach, Cost Approach, and Income Approach are all necessary to properly reflect the property’s “subject to” condition and continued use as an apartment complex.
Scope of Work

The scope of work for this appraisal report is defined in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and tailored to meet the specific requirements of the intended use and user of the appraisal. The following outlines the steps and criteria involved in completing the appraisal process:

Purpose and Intended Use of the Appraisal:
The purpose of this appraisal is to estimate the market value of the subject property as of the effective date of the appraisal.
The intended use of this report is to assist the client with internal decision making purposes.
The intended user of this report is the named client, and no other use or user is intended or authorized.

Inspection and Data Collection
Conducted an on-site inspection of the land, improvements, and surrounding area.
Took photographs and measurements to document the property’s condition and characteristics.
Collected legal, ownership, and zoning information from public records, client documents, and direct observation.
Researched comparable sales, rental data, and income/expense figures from MLS, public records, and market participants.
Analyzed economic and market conditions (employment, demand, regional growth) relevant to value.

Analysis and Valuation Approach:
Cost Approach: If applicable, estimated replacement/reproduction cost less depreciation.
Sales Comparison Approach: Analyzed recent comparable sales to derive a market-based indication of value.
Income Approach: For income-producing properties, evaluated potential gross income, operating expenses, and capitalization rates. 
The applicability of each approach was considered, with the final valuation reconciled to provide the most reliable estimate of market value. The approaches to value are described in detail later within the report.

Zoning and Legal Compliance:
The property’s zoning classification and any applicable restrictions were reviewed to determine legally permissible uses.
Flood zone information and environmental conditions were considered to assess any potential impact on the property’s value.

Report Development:
Prepared the report in compliance with USPAP, presenting property details, market analysis, and supporting data.
Included any hypothetical conditions or extraordinary assumptions, which are clearly disclosed within the report.
Provided appraiser’s certification, limiting conditions, and assumptions to clarify responsibilities.

Limitations and Certifications:
The appraiser’s certification, limiting conditions, and assumptions are included in the report to clarify the scope of responsibility and ensure transparency.
The appraisal does not constitute an inspection for structural integrity, environmental hazards, or building code compliance.
Extraordinary Assumptions & Hypothetical Conditions

An extraordinary assumption is defined as: an assignment-specific assumption as of the effective date regarding uncertain information used in an analysis which, if found to be false, could alter the appraiser's opinions or conclusions.  Uncertain information might include physical, legal, or economic characteristics of the subject property; or about conditions external to the property, such as market conditions or trends; or the integrity of data used in an analysis. (USPAP, 2024 ed.) If any of our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the value opined herein may change.

 We have made extraordinary assumptions, as follows:

The appraiser utilized extraordinary assumptions in determining market rates and forecasting market trends, assuming that no unexpected or extreme economic, regulatory, or market disruptions occur that would significantly alter rental demand, expense patterns, or capitalization rates. These projections are based on historical trends and current market conditions, with the expectation that typical market forces will continue to influence the subject property’s performance in a stable manner.

A hypothetical condition refers to an assumption of condition that is contract to fact but is used for the purpose of the appraisal. It is a situation or scenario assumed by the appraiser for the sake of analysis, which does not reflect the actual state of the property. This condition is often used to estimate the value of a property under different scenarios or to understand how changes might impact value.(USPAP, 2024 ed.) If any of our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the value opined herein may change.

We have made hypothetical conditions, as follows:

The appraiser utilized the hypothetical condition that the ongoing renovation and remodeling is completed as planned and as described in this report.

It should be noted that the on-site visit was not intended to assess the structural integrity of any improvements, nor to determine compliance with building codes, should such improvements exist. No soil analysis or environmental study was available as of the date of this appraisal.  The appraiser is not qualified to detect or identify hazardous substances which may, or may not be present on, in, or near this property.  The presence of substances such as asbestos, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation, toxic waste, or other potentially hazardous materials may affect the value of the property.  The client is advised to obtain outside professional environmental studies and testing concerning environmental issues.

Tax Assessment Analysis

The Calcasieu Parish Tax Assessor reports the following assessment details for the subject property:

The tax assessment analysis relied on the 2025 assessment for the property found through the Calcasieu Parish Tax Assessor. The total tax payer amount is rounded to the nearest whole number.

The total assessed value of the subject property, at $25,110 is consistent with the values of similar use and style properties in the immediate area. Upon reviewing the tax records of neighboring properties, it was found that the subject’s taxpayer tax amount of $2,433.95 aligns closely with comparable properties. This suggests that the property is fairly assessed relative to the local market.
Neighborhood Analysis

A developed residential superpad within a master planned community usually having a distinguishing name and entrance. 3. A geographic area around a property that influences that property, i.e., its environment."


Neighborhoods may encompass residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, civic activities, or a combination thereof. Analyzing the neighborhood of a specific property is crucial, as the economic, social, political, and physical forces influencing the neighborhood directly affect the individual properties within it. Through neighborhood analysis, an appraiser examines how these factors impact property values.

Zoning Classification Conclusion

The subject property at 2221 Oak Park Blvd in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is governed by both the Mixed Use (MU) and Residential Dwelling (RES) zoning districts. The MU district accommodates a variety of residential and nonresidential uses, subject to bufferyard requirements and design controls, while the RES district emphasizes low‐density, single‐family development with limited complementary uses. Given the property’s current multifamily configuration and its proximity to main thoroughfares, utilities, and local services, it appears well‐positioned for continued residential occupancy or future redevelopment consistent with city regulations. Compliance with the density, buffering, and other district‐specific requirements will be necessary for any expansions or changes in use.
Improvements Analysis

The subject property is a two‐story multifamily complex with a gross building area (GBA) of approximately 23,932 square feet—about 12,090 square feet on the first floor and 11,842 square feet on the second floor. A 251‐square‐foot utility closet for property management is located on the first floor, leaving a net rentable area (NRA) of roughly 20,130 square feet (84% of the total GBA). The second floor is accessible via multiple exterior stairways, primarily within the courtyard. GBA encompasses the total enclosed floor area measured to the exterior walls, regardless of use, including walkways and porches. In addition, the site features around 10,198 square feet of concrete parking, 2,998 square feet of which is covered, plus 3,551 square feet of covered walkways throughout the complex.

The primary structure features a brick and block exterior with a gable styled asphalt roof and a covered walkway lining each unit’s entrance. At the time of inspection, some units were nearing completion; it is assumed that all unfinished units will be constructed with comparable materials and quality. Each unit offers vinyl flooring, painted drywall walls and ceilings, wood trim, insulated windows, modern vanities, and appliances, as well as a private laundry room. Below is a table detailing the subject’s 19 apartment units by layout and size.

Highest and Best Use

A property must be appraised in terms of its highest and best use.  According to The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 7th Edition (Appraisal Institute), highest and best use is defined as:

 The reasonably probable use of property that results in the highest value. The four criteria that the highest and
best use must meet are legal permissibility, physical possibility, financial feasibility, and maximum productivity.”

The highest and best use of both land as though vacant and property as improved must meet four criteria.  The highest and best use must be:  1) physically possible, 2) legally permissible, 3) financially feasible, and 4) maximally productive.  The maximally productive use of the site is generally considered the highest and best use as of the appraisal date.

Physically Possible

This criterion assesses what uses are physically possible on the property, considering its size, shape, topography, access, and availability of utilities.

Size and Shape: The subject property measures approximately 200 feet along Oak Park Blvd and 266.87 feet in depth, encompassing a total site size of approximately 1.23 acres (53,382 square feet). The rectangular configuration allows for efficient site utilization for residential or mixed-use development.
Topography: The land is generally level and at grade, requiring minimal site preparation for continued residential or alternative development.
Accessibility: The property fronts Oak Park Blvd, a primary thoroughfare, providing strong visibility and accessibility. A public access alley along the rear further enhances ingress/egress options for residents and service vehicles.
Utilities: The site has access to essential public utilities, including water, electricity, and sewer, supporting its existing residential use and potential redevelopment.
Zoning Compliance: The subject falls within Mixed Use (MU) and Residential Dwelling (RES) zoning districts, allowing for multifamily residential, limited commercial, and institutional uses, subject to density and bufferyard requirements.

Conclusion: The subject property meets the physically possible criterion for continued multifamily residential use or potential mixed-use redevelopment. Its size, shape, level terrain, strong access, and zoning allowances support a range of development scenarios within permitted land use regulations.
Legally Permissible

The test of legal permissibility considers property uses that are currently allowed or likely allowable under applicable zoning codes, building codes, environmental regulations, and other land-use laws.

Zoning: The subject property is zoned Mixed Use (MU) and Residential Dwelling (RES). The MU zoning allows for a variety of residential and nonresidential uses, including multifamily, limited commercial, and institutional uses, subject to density and buffering requirements. The RES zoning primarily permits low-density residential development, with limited conditional uses for institutions and home businesses.
Current Use Compliance:  The existing multifamily use aligns with the MU zoning designation, while any future modifications, expansions, or changes in use would need to conform to zoning regulations for both MU and RES classifications.
Environmental Restrictions: The property is located in Flood Zone X, indicating minimal flood risk. There are no known environmental restrictions, such as wetlands or protected habitats, that would significantly impact redevelopment.
Building Codes: Any future renovations, redevelopment, or structural modifications must comply with current building codes, zoning requirements, and safety regulations applicable to the Mixed Use and Residential Dwelling districts.

Conclusion: The subject property meets the legally permissible criterion, with zoning and regulations allowing for continued multifamily use and potential redevelopment within the constraints of the MU and RES zoning designations. No legal restrictions have been identified that would prevent its current or future utilization under permitted uses.

Financially Feasible

This criterion determines which of the physically possible and legally permissible uses are likely to produce a positive rate of return. Factors such as physical characteristics, zoning, location, access, and market demand are considered.

Physical and Legal Factors: The subject property measures approximately 160 feet along Oak Park Blvd and 208.5 feet in depth, totaling approximately 0.766 acres (33,360 square feet). The rectangular shape allows for efficient site utilization for residential or mixed-use development.
Market Demand: Lake Charles serves as a regional hub with a strong rental market supported by local industries, including petrochemicals, healthcare, and education. The area’s growing demand for rental housing, particularly in well-located neighborhoods, suggests continued feasibility for multifamily use.
Economic Trends: The Lake Charles economy is anchored by industrial, healthcare, and entertainment sectors, contributing to a steady demand for housing. Recent development projects and ongoing infrastructure improvements support long-term economic stability, reinforcing the demand for multifamily rental properties.
Potential Returns: The property’s zoning, location, accessibility, and market conditions indicate strong investment potential. Multifamily rental operations are likely to generate a stable income stream, while future redevelopment under the Mixed Use zoning could further enhance returns. Given the demand for rental housing, the property is financially viable for continued multifamily use, with the potential for mixed-use redevelopment if market conditions support it.

Conclusion: The subject property meets the financially feasible criterion, with continued multifamily residential use presenting the most viable option. The combination of strong market demand, favorable zoning, and location advantages supports its profitability as a rental property, with redevelopment potential for mixed-use applications in the future.
Maximally Productive

This criterion identifies the use that meets the physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible criteria, and yields the highest value.

Optimal Use: The highest and best use of the subject property is continued multifamily residential use in its renovated condition. The existing 19-unit apartment complex aligns with market demand for rental housing and is supported by the Mixed Use (MU) and Residential Dwelling (RES) zoning designations. While limited mixed-use potential exists under MU zoning, the property’s current configuration and demand for rental housing make multifamily the most productive use at this time.
Synergy with Surroundings: The property is situated within a mixed-use and residential neighborhood, with schools, retail businesses, healthcare facilities, and employment centers nearby. Maintaining multifamily use supports the area’s housing needs and complements surrounding land uses, particularly given the demand for rental housing in the Lake Charles market.
Long-Term Viability: Lake Charles has a stable rental market, driven by regional employment in industrial, healthcare, and education sectors. The property’s location along Oak Park Blvd, a primary roadway, ensures continued desirability for tenants seeking convenient access to employment, schools, and services.
Value Maximization: The property’s highest value is achieved through its current multifamily use, which generates stable rental income and benefits from renovations that extend its economic lifespan. While redevelopment for mixed-use could be considered in the long term, the strongest immediate return is through maintaining its functioning apartment complex in alignment with current market conditions.

Conclusion: The maximally productive use of the subject property is continued multifamily residential use. This use aligns with zoning regulations, complements surrounding land uses, maximizes value through rental income, and supports long-term demand in the local housing market.

Overall Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the four criteria—physically possible, legally permissible, financially feasible, and maximally productive—the highest and best use of the subject property at 2221 Oak Park Blvd, Lake Charles, LA, 70605 is as follows: 

As Vacant: Given its size, rectangular shape, zoning designations (MU & RES), and frontage along Oak Park Blvd, the site is well-suited for continued multifamily residential development or potential mixed-use redevelopment. The availability of public utilities and strong accessibility supports a variety of residential and limited commercial applications within the Mixed Use zoning district, subject to regulatory requirements.
As Improved: The existing 19-unit multifamily complex aligns with market demand for rental housing and is financially viable as a continued income-generating property. The recent renovations extend the property’s economic life, and its location near schools, employment centers, and commercial services supports long-term rental stability. While the MU zoning allows for additional mixed-use potential, the current multifamily configuration remains the most practical and profitable use at this time.

Conclusion: The subject property meets all four highest and best use criteria for continued multifamily residential use as improved. Its location, zoning allowances, and recent renovations contribute to long-term financial viability and strong rental market demand. The appraiser was not provided with, nor has developed, specific renovation costs, projected market rents, or potential income forecasts. This analysis is based on the hypothetical condition that all renovations are completed, and that the property is in very good condition for its intended use..
The Three Approaches To Value 

Appraisers traditionally consider three primary approaches to value: the Sales Comparison Approach, the Cost Approach, and the Income Capitalization Approach. Each approach provides a unique perspective on market value and is applied based on the property’s characteristics and the availability of market data.

Sales Comparison Approach

The Sales Comparison Approach estimates market value by analyzing recent sales of similar properties, reflecting the principle of substitution: a buyer would not pay more for a property than the cost of acquiring a comparable alternative. This approach is market-driven and widely applicable when reliable data on comparable sales is available. The process involves:
Data Collection and Market Analysis: Relevant market data is gathered from sources such as MLS, CoStar, proprietary databases, and public records. Market trends, buyer motivations, and conditions are analyzed for context.
Selection of Comparables: Comparable properties are selected based on location, size, use, condition, and other relevant factors to ensure market relevance.
Adjustment Process: Adjustments are made for differences in property rights, financing terms, market conditions, and physical attributes. These adjustments ensure that the comparables accurately reflect the subject property's value.

Cost Approach

The Cost Approach derives value by estimating the cost to replace or reproduce the property’s improvements, less depreciation, plus the value of the land. This approach is particularly effective for newer properties or those with minimal depreciation and provides additional support when market data is limited. The process involves:
Estimating replacement or reproduction costs using cost guides, such as Marshall and Swift, and consultations with local builders or contractors.
Subtracting accrued depreciation, including physical, functional, and external obsolescence.
Adding the value of the land, typically determined through market analysis of comparable sites.

Income Approach

The Income Capitalization Approach values a property based on its income-generating potential, emphasizing that market value is tied to current or expected income. It is primarily used for income-producing properties like rentals or commercial buildings. The method captures profitability and investor expectations, employing techniques based on property type, income characteristics, and investor preferences. This process involves utilization of the following methods:
Direct Capitalization Method:
Estimates value by applying a market-derived capitalization rate (cap rate) to the property’s net operating income (NOI). The cap rate reflects expected return, determined by analyzing comparable sales, market conditions, and investor behavior.
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis:
Projects future cash flows over a holding period (typically 5-10 years), including income, expenses, and sale proceeds, then discounts them to present value using a discount rate that reflects risk and market conditions.


Value Reconciliation

The final opinion of value is typically derived by reconciling the results of the applicable approaches. The most reliable method is prioritized based on the property’s characteristics and market data availability. Each approach is weighted based on its relevance and the quality of available data to provide a credible and supported opinion of market value.
SALES COMPARISON APPROACH

The Sales Comparison Approach was employed to estimate the market value of the subject property by analyzing recent sales of comparable properties, following the principle of substitution: a rational buyer would not pay more for a property than the cost of acquiring a comparable alternative. This approach provides a reliable indicator of value, reflecting current market trends, buyer and seller behavior, and the subject’s market positioning.

The subject property is a multifamily apartment complex undergoing a full renovation, replacing most major components. Comparable sales were selected based on similar construction characteristics, market influences, gross building area, and overall condition to ensure an accurate valuation.

Adjustments were made to the comparable sales to account for differences in location, use, condition, and other relevant factors, ensuring a credible and market-supported valuation of the subject property upon completion of renovations. Land-to-building ratios were also considered, with adjustments made to reflect the impact of additional land utility and its contribution to overall property value.

Adjustments were made to the comparable sales to account for differences in location, use, condition, and other relevant factors, ensuring a credible and market-supported valuation of the subject property upon completion of renovations. Land-to-building ratios were also considered, with adjustments made to reflect the impact of additional land utility and its contribution to overall property value.

Maps, photographs of the comparable sales, and detailed adjustment grids are included later in the report to substantiate the valuation conclusions.

The process for developing this approach included:

Data Collection and Market Analysis: Sales data was collected from multiple sources, including MLS, CoStar, proprietary databases, public records, and local brokers. Current market trends, buyer motivations, and regional economic conditions were analyzed to ensure data relevance.
Selection of Comparables: Properties were selected based on their relevance to the subject property, considering factors such as location, property type, size, and zoning. Separate sets of comparables were identified for improved and vacant land analyses.
Adjustment Process: Adjustments were applied to account for differences in property rights, financing terms, market conditions, and physical characteristics. These adjustments ensure that each comparable accurately reflects the subject property’s market value.

The Sales Comparison Approach is particularly applicable to the subject property due to the availability of market data and its alignment with market participant behavior. This method provides a clear, market-oriented value conclusion and serves as the foundation for both improved property and land valuation in this report.

A detailed market rent analysis, including comparable properties and supporting data, is provided later in this report.

Analysis of Adjustments

Units of Comparison

In the Sales Comparison Approach, the primary unit of comparison used in this analysis is the sales price per net rentable area (NRA), as this metric is most relevant for buyers of investment properties such as apartment complexes. While price per gross building area (GBA), price per unit, and price per bedroom were also calculated for support, price per NRA was emphasized due to its direct relationship to rental income potential and investor decision-making.

Several factors influence variations in unit pricing, including sale conditions, date of sale, location, land-to-building ratio, and physical characteristics such as age, condition, and construction quality. Adjustments for these differences are discussed in the following sections. The subject, along with all comparable sales had appropriate parking ratios compared to their NRA. As such no further adjustments were necessary and this characteristic was not considered in the adjustment grid.

Size – Net Rentable Area

Smaller properties typically command a higher price per square foot of Net Rentable Area (NRA) because fixed costs such as utilities, maintenance, and other overhead expenses are spread across fewer rentable square feet, increasing the per-square-foot. In multifamily properties, NRA is a key valuation metric because it reflects the total rentable space that generates income, excluding non-rentable areas such as common hallways, mechanical rooms, and utility spaces. Since investors primarily focus on income potential rather than total building size, NRA provides a more accurate basis for comparison. As a result, when a smaller comparable is assessed against a larger subject property, a negative adjustment is applied to reflect the subject’s typically lower price per square foot of NRA. In this analysis, each halving or doubling of NRA relative to the subject results in a 10% adjustment, ensuring the comparable sales data accurately reflect the impact of size differences on value.

Sale Conditions

Adjustments for sale conditions account for the motivations of the buyer and seller, which may influence the transaction. When a sale occurs under non-market conditions, adjustments are necessary to align the price with typical market conditions. Thorough research into the circumstances of each sale is essential before determining if an adjustment is warranted. In this analysis, all closed sales are considered arm’s length transactions, and no adjustments for sale conditions were required.

Cash Equivalency

The financing terms of a transaction can influence the sales price. Generally, all-cash sales reflect the lower end of the price range, while sales involving favorable financing terms tend to result in higher prices. To ensure consistency, the reported sales prices must be adjusted to reflect cash-equivalent terms. A cash equivalency adjustment converts the sale price to its present value—essentially the value in cash or equivalent terms—allowing for a fair comparison among different transactions. This cash-equivalent price is determined by calculating the present worth of all considerations at the time of sale, including cash, services, fees, or other non-realty items. The cash-equivalent price, along with the adjusted unit of comparison, then serves as the starting point for further analysis in comparative grids. In this case, all the transactions were conducted with cash or cash-equivalent terms to the seller, so no cash equivalency adjustments were necessary.
Sale Date

Real estate prices typically rise over time due to inflation, population growth, and limited land. In Southwest Louisiana—particularly near Lake Charles—several major events have impacted property values: the 1980s energy-sector downturn, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, and Hurricane Laura in 2020. After stabilizing in the 1990s, the region faced new challenges from storm damage, supply-chain disruptions, and the COVID-19 pandemic, influencing market conditions and population trends in the Sulphur area. Although prices surged briefly due to rebuilding demand, they have since stabilized. Historically, commercial property values grew by about 3% annually, interrupted by the 2008–2010 downturn and again from 2020 to 2023. Paired sales data from late 2023 and early 2025 indicate a return to this 3% growth rate, which has been applied as appropriate in this analysis. 

Location & Zoning

Location directly impacts property value, with high-visibility sites along major roadways typically commanding higher prices. Corner lots also tend to be more desirable than interior or secondary road locations. In this analysis, location adjustments were primarily addressed by isolating and extracting land value, eliminating the need for additional adjustments to most sales.

Zoning influences value by determining allowable uses and development potential. Properties with more flexible or commercially favorable zoning generally have greater market appeal, while restrictive zoning can limit utility and value. Although Comparable Sale 2 is located in Westlake and features a B-1 commercial zoning designation, no adjustment was applied for zoning differences. The rationale for this decision is based on the market influence of location versus zoning. 

While B-1 zoning allows for a broader range of commercial uses, the overall demand and pricing trends in Lake Charles are generally stronger than those in Westlake, resulting in a higher baseline property value regardless of zoning classification. In this case, the location difference between Westlake and Lake Charles had a more significant impact on market value than the zoning distinction. Because the subject’s location in Lake Charles inherently commands higher property values, there was no discernible market-based difference in value attributed solely to zoning. Instead, the location adjustment applied to Comparable Sale 2 effectively accounted for any variance in marketability and demand, rendering a separate zoning adjustment unnecessary. 

Adjustments were applied where significant differences existed between the subject and comparable sales.
Comparable 2, located in a less desirable market area (Westlake), received a +25% adjustment for location.
Comparable Sales 3 and 5, both in superior commercial areas of Lake Charles with more flexible zoning, received -15% adjustments to reflect their advantages.
Comparable sale 4 was given an adjustment of +5% for its zoning classification being only residential.

Land/Building Ratio

Properties with larger land-to-building ratios generally command higher unit prices, as the additional land typically enhances the property's utility. This extra land contributes additional value to the overall property, which is accounted for through adjustments based on the land/building ratio. In this analysis, sales with varying ratios have been adjusted at a rate of 5% for each doubling or halving of the land/building ratio.
Overall  Improvement Quality & Condition

In this analysis, a property’s condition—including physical deterioration, deferred maintenance, and overall quality of finishes—is reflected through its effective age. Factors such as higher-grade finishes, unit appliance hookups, higher-quality lighting, interior material quality such as flooring, and available amenities are examples of quality features were considered. 
Comparable sale 1 featured improvements with a below average quality as it featured low cost interior flooring, appliances, and finishes. As such comparable sale 1 and was given a 25% adjustment for overall quality.
Comparable 2 was given a quality adjustment of 5% as it did not contain in unit laundry hookups such as the subject and all other comparable sales used.

To address condition differences, an adjustment of 1.8% per year was applied based on effective age. This rate was determined using the total economic life of 55 years, calculating yearly deterioration and applying it to differences in effective age. Since effective age serves as a measure of condition, adjustments were made solely based on how the subject’s effective age compares to that of each comparable sale. The subject property’s 55-year economic life serves as the benchmark for determining these condition-related adjustments.

Comparable Sale 1 features inferior construction quality compared to the subject, resulting in a shorter total economic life of 45–50 years, whereas the subject's total economic life is 55 years. Due to the varying building styles and quality within Comparable Sale 1, a base adjustment was calculated by comparing economic life ratios. After further review of building materials, design quality, and construction characteristics through public sources, the appraiser determined that a 25% adjustment more accurately reflects the quality difference. This final adjustment accounts for the subject’s superior materials and longer-lasting construction compared to Comparable Sale 1. Using the lower range of Comparable Sale 1's economic life (45 years), the ratio was calculated as:


Final Adjustment % = Base Adjustment % + Appraiser’s Discretionary Adjustment

Flood Zones

Certain flood zones carry a higher risk of flooding and therefore often require additional improvements or building-code considerations. Properties within these zones may be subject to stricter regulations—such as elevated foundations, flood-resistant construction materials, or enhanced drainage systems—to comply with local and federal standards. Additionally, lenders and insurers may impose higher premiums or more stringent requirements for properties in these areas, which can affect both financing and overall market value. As a result, buyers and developers must carefully weigh the costs and benefits of building or purchasing in zones with elevated flood risk. All comparable sales used were in a similar flood zone as the subject and no further adjustments were necessary.

In the final reconciliation, the greatest emphasis was placed on comparable sales 3, 4, and 5 due to their closer alignment with the subject property in terms of condition, site size, location, and construction quality. Less weight was given to comparable sales 1 and 2.
Comparable Sale 1 was given the least consideration due to its inferior construction quality and lack of conformity in building style and unit layout compared to the subject.
Comparable Sale 2 received minimal weight due to its location in Westlake, a less desirable market area relative to the subject.
Comparable 4 received a lower weight due to the marketing time difference between the comparable sale and the effective date of the subject’s valuation.

Overall, the appraiser acknowledges the variations in property characteristics, market conditions, and geographic proximity among the comparable sales. These differences reflect the limited availability of directly comparable sales within the immediate market area. Despite these variations, the comparable sales selected remain reliable indicators of market value. Adjustments were applied to account for differences in location, condition, unit composition, and other relevant factors to ensure an accurate reflection of the subject property’s value.

Based on this analysis, the final reconciled value is $100 per square foot of net rentable area (NRA). This value is supported by market trends and adjustments derived from the comparable data.

Cost Approach

The Cost Approach is based on the principle that a property's value can be determined by adding the land value to the current cost of constructing a replacement for the improvements, then deducting accrued depreciation from physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, or external obsolescence. This method is particularly useful for properties that are new, recently renovated, or not frequently transacted in the market.

This analysis is based on the concept of replacement cost. According to The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 7th Edition (Appraisal Institute), replacement cost is defined as:

"The estimated cost to construct, at current prices as of a specific date, a substitute for building or other improvements, using modern materials and current standards, design, and layout.”

The subject property is undergoing a complete renovation, with all major components being repaired or replaced. Given this, the Cost Approach is appropriate, as it reflects the cost to reconstruct the subject’s improvements to a new or like-new condition. Since this valuation is subject to the completion of renovations, the analysis provides insight into the relationship between replacement cost and market value, accounting for depreciation and any remaining obsolescence.

To ensure accuracy, replacement cost estimates were derived from multiple industry sources:
Conversations with Contractors and Architects – Real-time data on material costs, labor expenses, and current industry trends from professionals actively involved in construction.
Discussions with Investors, Managers, Owners, and Operators – Perspectives on development costs, operational considerations, and market expectations for similar properties.
Marshall Valuation Service Data – Standardized replacement and reproduction cost figures from Marshall Valuation Service, a widely recognized cost guide published by Marshall & Swift.

The Cost Calculator section of the Marshall Valuation Service provides base costs for the subject's improvements, which are detailed in the following analysis.

Cost Components

Hard Costs
These include direct costs such as materials, labor, and contractor overhead and profit. Additionally, estimates for site preparation, paving, and utility systems were derived from Marshall Valuation.

Soft Costs
Soft costs represent indirect costs, such as entrepreneurial profit, professional fees, financing costs, appraisal fees, interest, and carrying charges.

Indirect costs such as legal and architectural fees are typically included in Marshall Valuation Services data. However, additional costs such as appraisal fees, interest, and carrying charges are not covered in these figures. To account for these, an 6% line-item adjustment has been included.

Entrepreneurial profit is estimated at 10% of total hard costs, representing the return an entrepreneur expects for their risk, expertise, and value creation in development.
Depreciation Analysis

Depreciation is measured using the Modified Economic Age-Life Method, which applies the ratio between a building’s effective age and its total economic life to the replacement cost, after accounting for any curable physical or functional deficiencies. The formula for depreciation is as follows:



This approach aligns with market-standard investor and developer practices, where economic life estimates are preferred over physical life estimates, and effective age is used instead of actual age to reflect the condition and functionality of the improvements.

Vacant Site Value

The table below details the vacant site sales used as comparable sales to determine the vacant land value for inclusion within the Cost Approach. While no adjustments are displayed, the appraiser analyzed the characteristics impacting value between the subject property and the land sales utilized.

Indicated Value of the Cost Approach = $2,250,000
(Value rounded to the nearest $50,000 during final reconciliation)

Income Approach

The Income Capitalization Approach estimates property value by converting anticipated future income into present value. This method was developed as it is particularly relevant for income-generating properties, as it reflects how investors assess value based on expected returns.

According to The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 7th Edition (Appraisal Institute), two primary methods are used in income-based valuation:

Direct Capitalization Method – A method used to convert an estimate of a single year’s income expectancy into an indication of value in one direct step, either by dividing the net income estimate by an appropriate capitalization rate or by multiplying the income estimate by an appropriate. The direct capitalization formula is as follow:

		Where:
V = Value of the property
NOI = Net Operating Income
R = Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method – The procedure in which a discount rate is applied to a set of projected income streams and a reversion. The analyst specifies the quantity, variability, timing, and duration of the income streams and the quantity and timing of the reversion, and discounts each to its present value at a specified yield rate. The DCF formula is as follows:

		Where:
V = Present Value (market value of property)
CFt = Net Cash Flow in Year t 
r = Discount Rate (Required Rate of Return)
t = Year of the Holding Period
n = Total Holding Period In Years
RV = Reversion Value

Rational for Selected Method - Discounted Cash Flow

Given the current state of the subject property—a 19-unit apartment complex undergoing complete renovation after years of vacancy—the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method is the most appropriate valuation approach.

Lease-Up Period & Unstabilized Income – The subject is currently vacant, requiring an absorption period to reach stabilized occupancy. The DCF method allows for modeling ramp-up income assumptions, making it superior to Direct Capitalization, which relies on a stabilized NOI.
Lack of Historical Financials – Due to prolonged vacancy and hurricane-related damage, no historical income, expense, or operating data is available. The DCF approach enables the appraiser to develop market-supported assumptions for rent, vacancy, and operating costs based on comparable market data.
Exit Strategy & Investor Perspective – The property is undergoing significant capital improvements, making it likely that investors will consider resale upon stabilization. The DCF method accounts for this through a terminal value (reversionary sale), reflecting potential future appreciation and return on investment.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Discounted cash flow analysis, as defined in The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, 7th Edition (Appraisal Institute), states:

‘The procedure in which a discount rate is applied to a set of projected income streams and a reversion. The analyst specifies the quantity, variability, timing, and duration of the income streams and the quantity and timing of the reversion, and discounts each to its present value at a specified yield rate.’

Due to the subject property undergoing renovations and the absence of historical income and expense data resulting from its prolonged vacancy, the appraiser will estimate financial projections based on current market conditions and comparable properties. The following key assumptions will be developed using market data to ensure an accurate valuation:

Market Rent Estimates – Based on comparable apartment rents for similar renovated units.
Vacancy & Collection Loss – Determined from local multifamily occupancy trends and lease-up projections.
Operating Expenses – Estimated using regional expense ratios for similar properties.
Capitalization & Discount Rates – Based on market transactions and investor expectations for multifamily assets in the local area.
Market Trends & Typical Holding Periods – Holding period assumptions align with investor expectation.

The valuation follows the standard approach to Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, utilizing unleveraged cash flows to estimate the property's financial performance over a defined holding period. This ensures an objective market valuation by discounting future net operating income and capital expenditures without consideration of specific ownership financing. The resulting present value reflects the property’s intrinsic worth based on expected cash flow and investor return requirements.

A detailed market rent analysis, including comparable properties and supporting data for all areas of the income approach, is provided later in this report.
Market Rent Analysis

The Market Rent Analysis establishes an estimate of achievable rental income for the subject property based on comparable market data. Since the subject is undergoing renovation and lacks historical rental figures, market-supported rents were derived from similar properties in comparable locations.

In this analysis, qualitative adjustments are applied to assess rental trends without assigning specific numerical values to differences. Instead of adjusting for individual unit features on a per-dollar basis, the subject's projected rent is based on observed patterns in rental pricing, particularly in relation to:
Rent per square foot comparisons
Rent per bedroom count
Overall condition of properties
General market conditions and demand

Based on the analysis of comparable rental properties and market conditions, an estimated market rent has been determined for each unit type within the subject property. These estimates reflect competitive rental rates for properties with similar characteristics, considering factors such as unit size, amenities, and overall condition. The following table outlines the projected rent for each unit, forming the basis for the Potential Gross Income (PGI) calculation.

TOTAL PGI










$214,800


Based on the estimated market rents for each unit type, the subject property's total Potential Gross Income (PGI) is projected at $214,800 annually. This figure serves as the foundation for further analysis in the Income Approach, including deductions for vacancy, collection loss, and operating expenses, which will be detailed in subsequent sections.
Vacancy & Collection Loss Analysis

The market vacancy and collection loss rate for the subject property is estimated at 10%, based on market data, comparable properties, and expected lease-up trends. The subject's predominant 2-bedroom unit mix (17 out of 19 units) benefits from strong demand, contributing to a faster absorption rate. Additionally, under the hypothetical condition that renovations are completed, the units will be in like-new condition, enhancing their competitiveness in the market.

Lease-Up Period Analysis

The graph below illustrates three potential lease-up scenarios based on different market conditions:
Optimistic Scenario (2 months per unit): Full lease-up in ~38 months (3.2 years), requiring aggressive marketing efforts.
Market Average Scenario (3.5 months per unit): Full lease-up in ~66.5 months (5.5 years), assuming typical market conditions.
Conservative Scenario (5 months per unit): Full lease-up in ~95 months (8 years), reflecting weaker demand.

The graph above illustrates three potential absorption scenarios for the subject property, considering different market conditions.

The Optimistic Lease-Up Scenario (2 months per unit) was selected for further financial modeling, as it aligns with:
The subject’s desirable unit mix and location.
Strong demand for 2-bedroom units in the market.
The assumption that prudent advertising and marketing strategies will be implemented.
The property being delivered in like-new condition upon renovation completion.

Lease-Up Period & Stabilization

Vacancy estimates in the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model are applied using end-of-year projections, representing the expected vacancy rate at the close of each period rather than adjusting for fluctuations throughout the year. The table below outlines the projected occupancy and corresponding vacancy rates:

Year
Projected Occupancy Rate
Vacancy Rate Applied
Year 1
60-70%
30-40%
Year 2
80-90%
10-20%
Year 3
88-90% (Stabilized)
10% (Market Rate)


Impact on the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
Vacancy rates are applied using end-of-year projections, ensuring consistency in the model.
Higher vacancy rates in Years 1 and 2 reflect the lease-up period, where units are gradually absorbed into the market.
By Year 3, the property is expected to reach a stabilized 88-90% occupancy, at which point a 10% vacancy rate is applied in line with market expectations.

This methodology ensures a market-supported vacancy projection while maintaining a practical approach to modeling the property’s lease-up performance.


Operating Expense Analysis

Due to the lack of historical financial data for the subject property, operating expenses have been estimated based on market standards for similar multifamily properties in the region. The applied expense ratios reflect typical allocations for Class C apartment complexes with a low effective age, considering industry benchmarks, regional trends, and comparable properties.

Market-Based Expense Projection

Operating expenses for comparable properties in the Lake Charles market typically range from 42% to 50% of Effective Gross Income (EGI). This includes both fixed and variable expenses, with allocations based on regional norms.
Fixed Expenses: Estimated at 14%–20% of EGI, including property taxes and insurance.
Variable Expenses: Projected at 25%–30% of EGI, including maintenance, utilities, and administrative costs.

Key Regional Expense Considerations

Utilities: Market data indicates that owner-paid utility expenses vary depending on lease structures, with allowances made for common areas and shared services. Regional climate conditions, particularly cooling costs, influence projected utility expenditures.
Management: Typical market management fees for multifamily properties in this size range fall between 8%–10% of EGI, accounting for either third-party or owner-management structures.
Repairs & Maintenance: Newly renovated properties typically experience lower short-term maintenance costs, but industry standards suggest reserves for ongoing upkeep and unexpected expenses should still be included.

Expense Allocation Based On Market Standards

The following table outlines market-derived expense estimates as a percentage of EGI to develop a total operating expense ratio (OER), based on comparable properties with similar renovation levels and regional cost factors.

Expense Category

Operating expenses have been applied using market-supported estimates, reflecting typical cost structures for a fully renovated Class C apartment complex. A total expense ratio of 45% of EGI aligns with regional and industry norms, ensuring a reasonable projection for financial modeling.


Capitalization & Discount Rates Analysis

This section outlines the assumptions used in the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, including the expense growth rate, capitalization rate, and period considerations. These assumptions are based on regional multifamily market trends, historical data, and investor expectations.

Expense Growth Rate Assumption (4%)

Operating expenses for multifamily properties have fluctuated in recent years due to inflationary pressures, rising insurance premiums, and increasing maintenance costs. Based on historical trends and industry data, a 4.0% annual expense growth rate has been applied throughout the projection period.

Market Data Supporting the Expense Growth Rate
Pre-2020 Norms: Multifamily expenses in Louisiana historically grew at 3.0%–4.0% annually, aligning with inflation and industry benchmarks.
Recent Cost Surges: Insurance and utility costs surged between 2021–2023, with some properties experiencing annual expense growth exceeding 8%.
Projected Stabilization: As inflation normalizes, operating expenses are expected to moderate, with 4% annual growth reflecting a conservative yet market-supported assumption.

This growth rate accounts for expected increases in insurance, taxes, utilities, and maintenance costs while avoiding excessive near-term volatility in the financial model. This 4% rate was also applied to the PGI through each period as such cost are usually passed on to tenants.

Capitalization Rate Assumption (8%)

The capitalization rate (cap rate) for the subject property is set at 8.0%, reflecting market conditions for Class C multifamily properties in tertiary Louisiana markets. This rate is consistent with recent transactions and investor expectations for similar assets.

Market Data Supporting the 8% Cap Rate
Historical Trends:
National apartment cap rates compressed to record lows (~5%) in 2021–2022 but have since expanded due to rising interest rates.
Lake Charles multifamily cap rates ranged from 7.5%–9.0% over the past few years, with Class C assets typically trading at 8.0%–9.0%.
Recent Market Shifts:
Rising interest rates and financing costs have driven cap rates upward, with secondary markets seeing cap rate expansion of 100+ bps since 2022.
As of 2024, Louisiana Class C properties are transacting around 8%–9% cap rates, supporting the selected 8.0% assumption.
Long-Term Projections:
Cap rates are expected to stabilize in the coming years, aligning with long-term investor return expectations.

This 8.0% cap rate assumption reflects both historical and forward-looking market conditions, ensuring an appropriate valuation approach.
Market Trends & Typical Holding Periods

The holding period assumption is based on prevailing market trends and investor expectations for multifamily properties. Recent industry data indicates that typical investment horizons for similar assets range between 5 to 10 years, with many investors opting for longer holds to maximize appreciation and rental income.

Typical Holding Periods For Multifamily Investments
Recent investor surveys indicate average hold periods of 8.5 to 9.3 years for apartment investments.
Multifamily investors historically targeted 3–5 years but holding periods have lengthened due to changing market conditions.
A 2023 study found that 71% of multifamily investors plan to hold for 10+ years, reflecting a shift toward longer-term ownership strategies.

Why a 10-Year Hold?
Stabilization & NOI Growth: The property benefits from long-term rent appreciation and occupancy stabilization.
Market Cycles & Timing: Holding the asset through a full market cycle mitigates short-term fluctuations.
Exit Strategy & Investor Expectations: Many investors model multifamily exits at the 10-year mark, making this assumption consistent with market-based underwriting practices.

This time frame optimizes projected returns while aligning with current investment trends.

10-Year Value Projection

At the end of the 10-year holding period, the subject property’s projected resale value is estimated using the terminal cap rate assumption of 8.5% and the expected NOI growth trajectory.

Historical & Projected Appreciation Rates
Lake Charles multifamily assets have historically appreciated at ~2%–3% annually.
Recent trends suggest slower price growth (~1.5% per year) due to rising cap rates and financing costs.
Forecasted appreciation for this asset assumes 2%–3% annual value growth over 10 years.

Using these assumptions, the property’s expected resale value is projected to be in the range of $2.4M to $2.7M, factoring in:
Projected NOI at stabilization.
An exit cap rate of 8.5% to reflect market conditions at the time of sale.
Industry-supported appreciation trends.



Using all previously discussed figures and estimates determined through the Market Rent Analysis, Vacancy & Collection Loss Analysis, Operating Expense Analysis, Capitalization & Discount Rate Analysis, and Market Trends & Typical Holding Periods sections, the appraiser can apply these market-supported findings to develop an opinion of value by the income approach using the direct capitalization method. The summary of findings and the final opinion of value are detailed on the following page.

Using the market-supported estimates developed throughout this analysis, the appraiser has formed an opinion of market value for the subject property using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. The valuation reflects projected income, expenses, and market conditions over the 10-year holding period, with the final value conclusion derived through the direct capitalization method.

The chart above outlines the DCF analysis and projected financial performance of the subject property over the 10-year holding period. The appraiser incorporated a lease-up period when applying Vacancy & Collection Loss to account for the time needed to achieve stabilized occupancy. A vacancy and collection loss rate of 35% was applied in Year 1, decreasing to 15% in Year 2, before reaching the stabilized market rate of 10% from Year 3 onward. These adjustments ensure a realistic projection of the subject’s income trajectory as it moves toward long-term operational stability.

This opinion of value is subject to the hypothetical condition that the renovation is completed as planned, ensuring the property is in very good condition upon stabilization. Additionally, all forecasts and projections are based on historical market trends, assuming no unforeseen economic disruptions or extreme market fluctuations.

Indicated Value of the Income Approach = $2,000,000
(Value rounded to the nearest $100,000 during final reconciliation)

Correlation Approaches to Value

In valuing the subject property under fee simple ownership, the three traditional valuation approaches were considered: the Cost Approach, Income Approach, and Sales Comparison Approach. Each approach was applied subject to the hypothetical condition that the rehabilitation of the improvements is completed, along with any additional conditions outlined within the respective approach sections.

Sales Comparison Approach

The Sales Comparison Approach was developed as the primary method for determining the market value of the subject property as improved, subject to the hypothetical condition that the renovations are completed. This approach analyzed recent comparable sales of similar properties, with adjustments made for key factors such as location, size, zoning, and flood zone classifications. This approach was applicable due to its reliance on direct market data and its ability to reflect buyer preferences and current market trends. The reconciled sales data indicated a price range reflective of the subject’s characteristics, leading to the following conclusion:

Value by Sales Comparison Approach - “Subject To”: $2,000,000

Cost Approach

The cost approach was developed in this analysis due to the ongoing rehabilitation of the property, which is expected to result in a low effective age. However, current high construction costs, coupled with the fact that some elements of the subject property are experiencing greater deterioration (or a higher effective age) than others, can lead to inflated results under this method. While the cost approach is most indicative of new construction, it remains applicable here. Nonetheless, it was not given any weight in forming the final opinion of market value but rather was developed to support the sales comparison and income approaches.

Value by Cost Approach: $2,250,000

Income Approach

The Income Approach was developed for this analysis as the subject property is a 19-unit multifamily complex expected to generate rental income upon lease-up. Due to the property’s extended vacancy and lack of historical income or expense data, a market-supported valuation was conducted using estimated rental rates, vacancy projections, and operating expense assumptions. A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis was utilized to account for the lease-up period, applying higher vacancy rates in the initial years before stabilizing at market levels. The final opinion of value was determined through the direct capitalization method, using a market-derived capitalization rate and projected net operating income.

Value by Income Approach: $2,000,000

Final Reconciliation of Value Approaches

The final opinion of value was determined by giving equal weighting to the Sales Comparison Approach and the Income Approach. The Sales Comparison Approach reflects market behavior and buyer preferences, relying on direct market data and comparable sales. The Income Approach was developed using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis to account for the lease-up period, applying market-supported rental rates, vacancy projections, and operating expense estimates. The alignment of values derived from both approaches further supports the reasonableness of the final conclusion.

The Cost Approach was also developed to establish the contributory value of the improvements. However, due to high construction costs and the potential for variability in replacement estimates, it was not given weight in the final reconciliation.

Based on the analyses and conclusions presented, the market value of the subject property, subject to the hypothetical condition that renovations are completed, as of the effective appraisal date, is:

Expanded Market Analysis & Data Support






Market Rent Determination

Due to the subject being valued under the hypothetical condition that the rehabilitation is completed, and the absence of a material list or bid outlining the scope of work, the appraiser did not conduct a detailed rental comparison with numerical adjustments, as was done in the Sales Comparison Approach. The lack of specific details regarding finishes, fixtures, and overall renovation quality makes precise quantitative adjustments between the subject and comparable rentals challenging to substantiate. Instead, the appraiser relied on a qualitative analysis to estimate market rent for each unit, considering general market trends, unit types, and observed rental patterns. The rental comparables used to support these estimates are detailed below.



Average Holding Periods for Multi‑Unit Apartment Investments in Louisiana

Typical Holding Durations (Current Market)
Most investors plan to hold multifamily properties for around 5 to 10 years.
Recent surveys indicate an average underwriting assumption of about 8.5 to 9.3 years.
Many individual investors (around 71% in one survey) expect to hold 10+ years, while only about 6% plan very short-term flips of under 2 years.

Louisiana Context
Though specific local data is limited, Louisiana investors generally mirror national trends.
Regional investment funds active in the Southeast (including Louisiana) often plan on 7-year holds, extendable up to 10 years.

Historical Trends
In past decades (1990s–2000s), it was common to exit within 3–5 years.
Over time, holds have lengthened: what used to be a 3–5 year norm has shifted toward 7–10+ years.
This shift has accelerated in recent years, with many owners now extending well beyond the old 5-year standard.

Primary Factors Influencing Longer Holds
Market Liquidity & Inventory Scarcity
Limited availability of quality replacement properties discourages selling.
Owners often refinance instead of sell, as they may struggle to reinvest proceeds into an equally strong deal.

Investor Strategy & Goals
Value-add investors aim for shorter holds (3–5 years), whereas buy-and-hold owners typically keep properties much longer (5+ or even 10+ years).
Tax considerations (e.g., capital gains, deferral opportunities) also encourage longer ownership.

Market Conditions & Outlook
Positive rent growth and demand for apartments motivate owners to “hold on” to capture ongoing income and appreciation.
During uncertain times, many choose to ride out short-term market dips and sell when conditions improve.

Interest Rates & Financing
Rising rates can reduce sale prices and make refinancing more attractive.
Owners with favorable, locked-in rates are often reluctant to sell, leading to extended hold periods.

Tax & Regulatory Considerations
Long-term capital gains treatment, 1031 exchanges, and estate planning incentives favor longer ownership.
Programs requiring multi-year commitments (e.g., Opportunity Zones) also extend holds.

Overall Takeaway:
For Louisiana’s multi-unit apartment properties, the market-standard holding period has shifted from around 3–5 years historically to a more common range of 5–10 years or longer today. This evolution is driven by limited inventory, ongoing rent growth, desire for stable income, rising interest rates, and tax-efficient strategies. Many investors are prepared to own multifamily assets for a decade or more to maximize returns and navigate changing market conditions.


Cost of Debt and Investor Demand

Investors generally set target cap rates by comparing a property’s expected return (its cap rate) to prevailing interest rates and alternative fixed-income yields. Here’s the high-level process:

Start With the Risk-Free Rate
Investors often use the 5-year or 10-year Treasury yield as the “risk-free” baseline.
Real estate must offer a yield (cap rate) above this baseline to compensate for greater risk.

Add a “Risk Premium”
On top of Treasuries, investors look for a certain risk premium (e.g., a few percentage points) to account for the property’s unique risks (location, property class, tenant stability, etc.).
In higher-risk environments—or for lower-quality assets—investors expect a larger premium, hence a higher cap rate.

Compare to Corporate Bonds
Corporate AAA and Baa bonds are benchmarks for slightly higher-risk debt. If corporate bonds pay, say, 5%, many investors will demand a higher return from real estate (e.g., a 6–8% cap rate) to justify illiquidity and operational burdens.
The exact spread depends on market conditions and the property’s perceived stability versus that of high-grade or lower-grade corporate debt.

Factor in Cost of Debt
Prime rates affect short-term lending, while Treasury yields feed into longer-term commercial mortgage rates.
If the cost of borrowing (interest rate on a mortgage) rises, the property’s cap rate must typically rise too—otherwise the deal may not produce enough cash flow to comfortably service debt.
Many investors aim for a “positive leverage” scenario where the property’s cap rate exceeds the loan interest rate, ensuring a margin above debt costs.

Market Dynamics
In low-rate environments, investors accept lower cap rates because debt is cheap, and alternative yields (e.g. Treasuries, bonds) are also low.
In high-rate environments, cap rates tend to increase because the investor’s required return (net of higher financing costs) must remain attractive relative to Treasuries and corporate bonds.

Overall, the interplay among risk-free rates (Treasuries), the cost of commercial debt (tied to prime and Treasury yields), and alternative bond yields (AAA, Baa, etc.) helps investors decide what cap rate makes sense to achieve a suitable return relative to the market’s overall interest-rate climate and risk conditions.

Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate) Forecast

Historical Cap Rate Trends: The Lake Charles multifamily market, as a tertiary Louisiana market, historically commands higher cap rates than large metro areas. Nationally, apartment cap rates compressed to record lows in 2021–2022 (around 5% average at the trough). For example, U.S. multifamily cap rates averaged 6.6% in 2020 and 6.4% in mid-2021, then fell further by late 2021. By mid-2022 many markets saw sub-5% caps on prime deals. Locally, Lake Charles Class C assets likely traded in the high-6% to 8%-range during that low-interest period (smaller markets carry a yield premium).

The rising interest rates of 2022–2023 drove cap rates back up. Cap rates expanded ~100 bps from the 2022 lows through early 2024. By Q1 2024, the average U.S. multifamily cap was ~5.7%, the highest since 2014. Class B/C and secondary-market properties saw even larger increases. In H2 2023 alone, multifamily cap rates decompressed ~50 bps as investor demand pulled back. Industry surveys confirm this trend: Marcus & Millichap reported the national apartment cap rate hit 5.8% in mid-2024, up 110 bps from the prior year. For Louisiana, cap rates are higher – e.g. older New Orleans apartments were trading around 7%–8%+ in late 2023 (anecdotal market reports). We can reasonably infer that a Class C Lake Charles deal today (2024) would trade around a 7.5% 8 % cap rate, reflecting both the interest-rate environment and a risk premium for a smaller market.

Annual Operating Expense Growth Forecast

Background & Recent Trends
Inflationary Pressures: During 2022–2023, inflation drove up multifamily operating costs nationwide – utilities increased by an average 14% year-over-year, insurance by ~33%, and maintenance/repairs by ~13.7%
Region-Specific Factors (Louisiana): Hurricane risks have driven insurance costs to climb well above national averages. Owners in Southwest Louisiana (including Lake Charles) have seen insurance premiums rise 15–30% annually in recent year. Utilities also remain high in the Gulf region due to extreme summer heat and higher water usage.

Short-Term (Years 1–2)
Because of ongoing supply-chain constraints, tight labor markets, and above-average insurance hikes, many forecasters (e.g., Marcus & Millichap, CBRE, and Moody’s Analytics) expect operating expenses to grow above general CPI in the near ter..
High insurance inflation in Louisiana is likely to persist, even if it moderates from the worst spikes. Maintenance/repairs may also remain elevated with ongoing labor/material constraints.

Medium-Term (Years 3–5)
As supply chains stabilize and new insurance carriers potentially enter or expand coverage, expense inflation could ease, although it will likely stay above pre-pandemic norms.
National forecasts often model a return toward 3% annual expense growth after the next 2–3 years.
Insurance may still run hot, but other expense categories (utilities, maintenance) may taper to closer to historical norms.

Long-Term (Years 6 and Beyond)
Over the long run, many investors revert to standard underwriting assumptions that operating expenses track at or near 2.5%–3.0% annual growth, in line with typical inflation plus a slight premium for property age and local factor.
Given that the property is fully renovated (low effective age), there may be a slight buffer against major capital-intensive repairs in the early holding period; however, insurance costs in coastal Louisiana will likely remain comparatively high.
Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for a small Class C apartment property can be substantial, often ranging around 45%–50% of the Effective Gross Income (EGI). Class C buildings (older, lower-rent properties) tend to be on the higher end of this range due to lower rents and higher upkeep needs; for example, properties with ~$800 monthly rent per unit commonly see expense ratios near 50% of income. Below is a breakdown of typical expenses by category, followed by key percentage metrics and regional insurance estimates, using industry data and surveys (NAA, IREM, etc.) as well as regional market insights.

Short Summary of Key Operating Expenses for a 19-Unit Class C Property (Lake Charles, LA)
Repairs & Maintenance (R&M)
Typically ~$950/unit/year nationally, higher for older Class C buildings.
Often 10–15% of EGI.
Utilities (Water, Sewer, Trash, Common Area Electric/Gas)
Commonly 7–10% of EGI.
Owner-paid utilities push costs higher, especially in hot/humid Lake Charles.
Rising utility rates (~14% YOY) also impact budgets.
Property Management Fees
For small multifamily, expect 8–12% of collected revenue (often ~10%).
Self-management can reduce costs but most underwriting includes a market-rate fee.
Administrative & Marketing
Generally 2–5% of EGI, covering office/legal/advertising.
Minimal on-site overhead for a 19-unit property.
Property Taxes
Typically 6–9% of EGI in Louisiana (lower tax rates vs. many states but still significant).
Often the largest or second-largest fixed cost.
Insurance (Hazard & Liability)
Historically 5–8% of op ex nationwide, but much higher in coastal Louisiana due to hurricanes.
Premiums can reach $800–$1,000+ per unit annually, ~10–15% of EGI for Class C.
Major factor pushing expense ratios up in Lake Charles.
Overall Expense Ratio
Expect 45–55% of EGI (often ~50%) for a 19-unit Class C.
Variable costs (R&M, utilities, management) ~25–35% of EGI.
Fixed costs (insurance, taxes) ~15–20% of EGI.
Historical Trend: Multifamily operating expenses in Louisiana and the broader Southeast have grown faster in recent years than the long-term average. In normal periods (pre-2020), annual expense growth was around 3%–4%; for example, expenses rose about 3.6%–3.8% in 2018–2019. However, inflationary pressures and spiking insurance costs drove unusually high increases of ~5% in 2021 and ~8.7% in 2022. The Southeast region saw the largest jump recently – 8.8% year-over-year as of early 2024 largely due to surging insurance premiums (property insurance up 27%+ nationally in 2023, and 35%+ in the storm-prone Southeast. Class C properties (older, lower-grade apartments) tend to face higher maintenance and insurance cost growth, especially in Lake Charles where recent hurricanes have caused sharp insurance hikes. National operators reported a 26% average jump in insurance costs from 2022 to 2023, with some Louisiana/Texas properties seeing 300–400% increases. This “rapid ascent is expected to continue into 2024” in catastrophe-prone regions like Louisiana, keeping near-term expense growth elevated.
