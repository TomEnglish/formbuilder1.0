- [x] Document identified boilerplate (`BoilerplateText.md`)
- [x] Integrate boilerplate text into `Certification` component
- [x] Integrate boilerplate text into `AssumptionsAndLimitingConditions` component
- [x] Integrate boilerplate text into other relevant components (e.g., Definitions in Scope of Work)
- [x] Populate placeholder components with basic structure/content based on sample report (Table of Contents completed)

## Phase 4: Valuation Logic, Data Input & Validation
- [x] **Implemented Core Validation Framework (`ValidationContext`)**
- [ ] **Sales Comparison Approach:**
    - [x] Implement basic UI for entering/displaying comparable sales data (local state)
    - [x] Implement field-level validation (required, numerical, date)
    - [x] Implement save mechanism (local state -> global context)
    - [x] Implement logic for adjustments
    - [x] Implement calculation for adjusted sale prices
    - [x] Implement reconciliation logic within Sales Comp section
- [ ] **Cost Approach:**
    - [x] Implement basic UI for entering land value, cost data, depreciation factors (local state)
    - [x] Implement field-level validation (required, numerical)
    - [x] Implement save mechanism (local state -> global context)
    - [x] Implement calculation for Replacement Cost New (within component)
    - [x] Implement calculation for depreciation
    - [x] Implement summation logic
- [ ] **Income Approach:**
    - [x] Implement basic UI for entering market rent, vacancy, expenses, rates (local state)
    - [x] Implement field-level validation (required, numerical)
    - [x] Implement save mechanism (local state -> global context)
    - [x] Implement calculation for PGI, EGI, NOI (within component)
    - [x] Implement Direct Capitalization calculation
    - [ ] Implement DCF analysis (Optional/Advanced)
- [ ] **Reconciliation:**
    - [x] Implement logic/UI to display values from the three approaches
    - [x] Implement logic/UI for final value conclusion analysis

## Phase 5: Print Output Refinement
- [x] Implement basic print trigger (`react-to-print`)
- [x] Add initial `@media print` CSS rules (hide elements, basic margins, reset styles)
- [x] Adjust layout width for print
- [x] Further refine print CSS for page breaks, headers/footers (if possible), and overall professional appearance
- [ ] Test print output across different browsers

## Phase 6: Styling & Branding
- [ ] Define/gather brand assets (logo, colors, fonts).
- [x] Update CSS (`index.css`) with primary brand color (`--primary-color: #337aff`).
- [x] Integrate company logo: Increased size in `ReportHeader` and added small logo (`Logo48.ico`) to `ReportFooter`.
- [ ] Refine overall UI element styling (buttons, inputs, containers) for professional look.
- [x] Ensure print styles also reflect branding: Added print CSS for fixed footer logo (`ReportFooter.css`).

## Phase 7: Final Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Web view & Print)
- [ ] PDF output validation
- [ ] User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Code cleanup and documentation
